# BURGER-S-EQUATION
I solved the Burgerâ€™s equation with a specific initial condition. I plotted the energy spectrum of the steady state for N=20 as the initial case, which is under-resolved, and later with higher N resolution to get DNS solution. Later, I produced results for the same case using LES solver to compare the results with the DNS solver
